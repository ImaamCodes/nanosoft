        <h1>CEO Biography</h1>

        <h2>Birthdate and Location</h2>
        <p>
            On December 16<sup>th</sup>, 2011, Abdulaah Abdulghaniyy's mother went to the hospital to 
            deliver. She later delivered at around 5:00AM (UTC+1). It was a Saturday, 17<sup>th</sup> 
            December and the city was Ibadan, Oyo State, Nigeria.
        </p>

        <h2>Family</h2>
        <p>
            He is the eldest of 4 children — one born 8<sup>th</sup> May 2014, another 17<sup>th</sup> 
            March 2017, and the last born on 6<sup>th</sup> December 2018. As the only boy AND eldest in 
            the house, he faces a lot of annoyance from his siblings and occasionally gets in trouble even 
            if he is innocent.
        </p>

        <h2>Current Living State</h2>
        <p>
            He goes to Ghars International School, AlKhoud, Seeb, Muscat, Oman and lives in Al Hail South, Seeb, 
            Muscat, Oman. 2 out of his 3 sisters go to the same school as him and his final sister goes to The 
            Happy Nursery in Al Hail South, Seeb, Muscat, Oman. It is on the way to Ghars International School 
            from his house. 
        </p>

        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <p>
            Abdullaah is currently an intermediate coder knowing how to code in HTML, CSS, JS, P.js, and Python. 
            He likes to code on Khan Academy, Code.org, Trinket, and VSCode. He is also a skilled Kodu Game Lab Developer 
            but acts as a guest user. He was also on Scratch before but his mother deleted his Scratch account.
        </p>

        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p>
            Abdullaah loves coding, playing sports, playing computer games, and physical games from England 
            (like Splat! and Collect the Treasure). His favorite things, however, by a long way are 
            experimenting, science, testing new things, and sleeping.
            <br>
            Foods are a fun thing to test for him. He usually likes tasting something for the first time and 
            eating things that he already knows has a good taste. If it's something like ice cream, he might 
            enjoy trying out a new flavour.
            <br>
            However, he hates testing things when it's just Stack Overflow giving him a whole bunch of solutions 
            to one thing that all don't work properly.
